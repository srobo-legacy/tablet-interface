# SR Tablet Interface

The interface for the tablets contained in the SR 2015 kit.

## Set up

External libraries are managed with `bower`, therefore you must have it installed and also make sure to install all the packages before testing:

    $ bower install

## Running

To run the interface you should serve the HTML from a web server, a quick way of doing this would be to use the `SimpleHTTPServer` found in Python 2.x.

    $ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
